<br>

<center><h1><b></b>Special Features üéä</b></h1></center>

<br>

 <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Item Display -</b></span> The /qs toggledisplay command can be used to enable or disable item displays for your shop. If enabled, the items will be displayed next to the chest for a visual representation of what's available for trade. This is especially useful for shop owners who want to show off the items they're selling.

<br>

 <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Staff Management -</b></span> The shop staff system allows multiple players to manage the same shop. Staff members can be added or removed with simple commands, and you can list all authorized staff members. This is great for group-run stores or when you need to give others access to your shops without transferring full ownership.

<br>

 <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Finding Shops -</b></span> The /qs find "item" command helps players quickly find shops selling a specific item, making it easier to locate where to buy or sell products in the marketplace.
