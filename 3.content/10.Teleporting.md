Teleportation commands save time and add convenience to your gameplay experience, so make sure you‚Äôre familiar with them and use them to your advantage! üöÄ


<br>

<center><h1><b></b>Random Teleport üåÄ (/rtp)</b></h1></center>

<br>

If you're feeling adventurous and want to explore the world without a specific destination in mind, the /rtp command is your best friend. This command randomly teleports you to a new location on the server, giving you the chance to discover new areas, find resources, or even stumble upon hidden secrets.

<br>

***Commands for rtp***

<span style="color:#f97316"><b>1.) </b></span> <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>/rtp -</b></span> Brings up a GUI where you can teleport to the Overworld, Resource world, The NEther, and The End.

<br>

***Important info:***

- You must be in an area where /rtp is allowed (e.g., not in a protected town or restricted area).


- Some servers may have restrictions on the /rtp cooldown (for example, you may only be able to use it once every X minutes).


- Random teleportation is great for exploration, but be ready for anything‚Äîthis might land you in an unfamiliar or dangerous spot!

<center><h1><b></b>Teleport to Another Player üë• (/tpa)</b></h1></center>

<br>

Want to visit a friend or see something someone else has built? The /tpa (Teleport Request) command allows you to request to teleport directly to another player. It's a great way to join your friends, assist others, or explore their areas.

<center><h1><b></b>Warps üèôÔ∏è (/warps)</b></h1></center>

<br>

If you're looking to quickly travel to common areas like the spawn, shops, or event zones, /warps is a great way to do so. Warps are pre-set teleportation points throughout the server that make getting around easier and faster.

<br>
