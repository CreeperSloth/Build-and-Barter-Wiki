- **Entropy**

<br>

Entropy is a currency used for Fishing. Entropy can be used to buy upgrades and augments.ou can obtain Entropy by catching custom fish, gutting fish in the Gutting Station (/fish gut), or Fishing up entropy crystals!

<br>

Entropy is a key stat that affects your ability to craft and use certain augments in the fishing system. It represents the chaotic energy required to combine ingredients in a cauldron and craft augments. Higher entropy levels enable you to access more powerful augments and enhance the effectiveness of your fishing rods. To manage entropy, you must keep an eye on your fishing stats, as the required entropy can vary based on the augment you're trying to craft. Be sure you have enough entropy before attempting to create or apply more advanced augments.

<br>

<center><h1><b></b>How to Craft Augments üî®</b></h1></center>

To create an augment for your fishing rod, you need to combine specific ingredients in a cauldron.

<br>

- **Crafting Process:**

<br>

Place the required ingredients for a specific augment into a full cauldron, and hit the cauldron with your fishing rod to craft the augment.

<br>

***Ensure you have the required fishing level, entropy, and the correct ingredients before attempting to craft an augment.***

<br>
