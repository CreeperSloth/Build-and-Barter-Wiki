<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Positioning -</b></span> Move the armor stand's body parts (head, arms, legs) along any axis.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Rotation -</b></span> Rotate body parts around chosen axes for custom poses.

<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Baseplate -</b></span> Show or hide the baseplate.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Gravity -</b></span> Enable or disable gravity for a floating or grounded stand.

<br>

<br>

<center><h1><b></b>Copy & Paste Armor Stand Configurations üìã</b></h1></center>


Want to reuse an armor stand setup across multiple places? The Armor Stand Editor makes this easy by letting you copy and paste configurations. This is especially useful for creating themed armor stands or repeating certain poses and setups in different parts of your build.

<br>

<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Copy -</b></span> Save the current armor stand's position, rotation, and item configuration.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Paste -</b></span> Quickly place a duplicate of the saved armor stand configuration in a new spot.

<br>

<center><h1><b></b>Customize Items Held by Armor Stands ‚öîÔ∏è</b></h1></center>

<br>

You can also edit the items an armor stand is holding, including armor, weapons, or other objects. This makes it an ideal tool for creating detailed displays or dioramas. Once you‚Äôve created the perfect pose and item setup, use the copy-paste feature to save and reuse your exact setup in different areas of your world.

<br>

<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Items -</b></span> Edit what the armor stand is holding, such as armor, weapons, shields, or even custom items.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Nametags -</b></span> Apply colored nametags, just like mobs, to give your armor stand unique identities or labels.

<br>    
    
<center><h1><b></b>Fine-Tune Poses and Body Parts üí™</b></h1></center>

<br>

For even more detailed control over your armor stand, you can rotate each body part (head, arms, legs) individually along any axis. Whether you want to make a dramatic pose or just adjust the stance, the Armor Stand Editor allows for precise adjustments. This feature is perfect for making armor stands look like they're interacting with the environment or performing specific actions, like holding a sword or saluting.

<br>

<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Rotation -</b></span> Use the editor to rotate the head, arms, or legs independently to create custom poses.


<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>Body Part Toggles -</b></span> Toggle the visibility or presence of specific body parts, such as removing arms or adjusting the rotation of the head.
    
<br>
    
<center><h1><b></b>Use the Armor Stand Editor for Large Builds üè∞</b></h1></center>

<br>

The Armor Stand Editor isn't just for creating static poses‚Äîit‚Äôs also a great tool for making large, detailed builds where you need multiple custom-posed armor stands. By combining copy-pasting and fine-tuning adjustments, you can fill an entire room or area with precisely positioned armor stands, each holding unique items and posing in specific ways.

<br>

Whether you're building a museum exhibit, a battle scene, or a role-playing setup, the Armor Stand Editor gives you total creative freedom.
