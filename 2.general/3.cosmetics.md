   - Custom cosmetics are a creative way to personalize and enhance your in-game environment and character appearances. They allow players to create elaborate outfits, accessories, or costumes, adding a creative touch to character design or storytelling in-game. Whether it‚Äôs for a fashion display, a museum, or a themed environment, custom cosmetics enable players to express their creativity and make their virtual spaces feel more unique and dynamic. You can use custom cosmetics on regular blocks, equip them as hats by running the command /hat, or place them on armor stands to use as mannequins.
