<center><h1><b></b>Town RTP üó∫Ô∏è (Random Town Teleport)</b></h1></center>

If you're looking for a bit of adventure and want to quickly find a new home in the game, the Town RTP feature is a great option. This feature teleports you to a random town, giving you the chance to explore different communities, see what they offer, and perhaps even find the perfect place to settle down.

<br>

- **Commands for Towny RTP:**

<span style="color:#22c55e;"><b>1.) </b></span> <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>/town rtp -</b></span> Teleport to a random town that fits the criteria.

<span style="color:#22c55e;"><b>2.) </b></span> <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>/town rtp ignore -</b></span> Teleport without receiving a cost warning.

<span style="color:#22c55e;"><b>3.) </b></span> <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>/town rtp autojoin -</b></span> Automatically join the town you are teleported to.

<br>

***Important Information:***

- You must not be an outlaw in the town you're teleported to.

- The town must be public and open to new members.

- The town must have a free plot available for you to claim.

<br>

For town mayors, if your town meets these criteria, it will automatically be added to the random teleport pool, increasing the likelihood that players will visit and potentially join. Once you‚Äôre teleported, you can use /town join <town name> to officially join the town, and /plot claim to claim the plot you land on if you decide to settle there.

If you'd prefer to take your time exploring towns, you can browse through open towns manually to find one that suits your preferences. This allows you to carefully consider your options and choose a community that aligns with your playstyle and goals.

<center><h1><b></b>Visit the Server‚Äôs Discord for Town Listings üåé</b></h1></center>

The server‚Äôs Discord is a valuable resource when searching for towns. Many town mayors use it to advertise their communities and recruit new members. By checking the Discord, you can discover towns actively seeking new players, learn about their features, and get in touch with mayors for more details.

<br>

- **Commands to Join the Discord Server:**


<span style="color:#22c55e;"><b>1.) </b></span> <span style="color:#FFFFFF"><b>/discord -</b></span> Get a link to the server‚Äôs official Discord.

<br>

Once you're in the Discord, check out the #towny-recruiting channel to find town listings. Some towns may not be open immediately, so messaging the mayor for more details may be necessary.


         
<center><h1><b></b>Ask in Server Chat ‚ùî</b></h1></center>

If you're unsure about which town to join or need some recommendations, the server chat is a great place to ask for help! Many players are happy to share information about open towns and offer suggestions based on their experiences. You may even receive direct invitations to join their communities!
