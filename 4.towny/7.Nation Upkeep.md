Nation upkeep is a crucial aspect of managing a nation's economy, serving as a simplified version of town upkeep. It ensures that the resources needed to maintain the operation of the nation are allocated efficiently. Properly managing nation taxes is essential to avoid financial strain and to support national growth and development.

Each town within a nation incurs a fixed daily upkeep cost. This cost is uniform across all towns, with each town requiring £750 per day for maintenance. As a nation leader, it is essential to monitor the total number of towns under your control, as the more towns you manage, the higher your nation’s overall daily upkeep will be.

Nation taxes play a pivotal role in the financial health of the nation. As a nation leader, you are responsible for setting the tax rates for each of your towns. Nation taxes are a flat rate and differ from town taxes, which may be based on percentages.
